# Team Profile Generator



## Description
The Team Profile Generator was created to help log Employee information for the manager of a software engineering team. It allows the manager to save employee information such as the employee's name, employee id, and role. For specific job titles, there is additional information that is added depending on the role. This allows the manager to have quick access to the employee's email addresses, Engineer's GitHub accounts, and Intern's school name.
